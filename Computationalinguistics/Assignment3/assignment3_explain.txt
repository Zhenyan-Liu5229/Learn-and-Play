Explanation for Mongolian Neural Network

Overview:
Input nodes:5    Each represent one syllable in a word
Output nodes:2   The first node represents the status of whether to stress the first syllable or not
                 The second represents the status of whether to stress the right most long vowel.

1. Inputs
Use the list of 0.0, 1.0, and -1.0 to represent each syllable in a Mongolian word:
- if the syllable contains only short vowels, then encode it as 0.0.
- if the syllable contains long vowels, 1.0.

  (To distinguish short vowels from long vowels,
  I checked whether a letter appears a second time in one syllable.
  That works for our training data, but if a Mongilian word is like 'ssan', it will cause some problems.)

- if the word contains less than 5 (which is the longest in the traning data) syllables,
  add -1.0 to the end to make len(input_node)==5 to achieve same input length.

  (Up to now, this Neural Network only works for our training data.
  If we want to test it with other Mongolian words,
  need to equal the length of input nodes to the length of the word which has the most syllables.)


2. Outputs
Use the list of 0.0 and 1.0 to represent the stress pattern of a word:
- if the first syllable is stressed, then encode this word as [1.0, 0.0],
- if the rightmost long vowel is stressed, [0.0, 1.0]

   (To achieve this, I went through the input nodes of each word.
    if input node of a word does not contain 1.0,
    then it only contains short vowels, and only needs to stress the first syllable.
    Otherwise, it contains long vowels, and needs to stress the right most long vowel.)
